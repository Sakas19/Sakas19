### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**Sakas19/Sakas19** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on finishing school with good grades
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning modern frontend frameworks like React to build dynamic and interactive web applications.
- ðŸ“š I'm actively seeking opportunities to apply my knowledge and collaborate on frontend projects.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to programming or technology.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a coffee aficionado and love trying different brews from around the world!

Take a look at my repositories to explore my frontend projects and let's collaborate on creating amazing web experiences together!
